  <p>The most common type of ransomware tactic involves restricting user access to files, folders, applications and even the operating system itself <br> through encryption, followed by a demand for a tranfer of money to the threat actor's bank account (usually in the form of cryptocurrency).</p>

  <p><strong>WannaCry</strong> is notriously known as one of the biggest ransomware attacks using this very same tactic. <br> Impacting over 300 organisations in over 150 countries and costing billions in damages, the origins were traced backed to the Lazarus Group. </p>
